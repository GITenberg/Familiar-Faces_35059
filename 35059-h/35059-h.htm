<h2>THE CRY OF THE PUBLISHER</h2>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O my Author, do you hear the Autumn calling?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Does its message fail to reach you in your den,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the ink that once so sluggishly was crawling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Courses swiftly through your stylographic pen?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis the season when the editor grows active,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the office-boy looks longingly to you.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Won't you give him something novel and attractive<br /></span>
<span class="i28">To review?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Never mind if you are frivolous or solemn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you only can be striking and unique,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The reviewers will concede you half a column<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In their literary journals, any week.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And 'twill always be your publisher's ambition<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To provide for the demand that you create,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dispose of a gigantic first edition,<br /></span>
<span class="i28">While you wait.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O my Author, can't you pull yourself together,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Try to expiate the failures of the past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And just ask yourself dispassionately whether<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You can't give us something better than your last?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you really&mdash;if you truly&mdash;are a poet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As you fancy&mdash;pray forgive my being terse&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Don't you think you might occasionally show it<br /></span>
<span class="i28">In your verse?<br /></span>

<h2>THE CRY OF THE AUTHOR</h2>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O my Publisher, how dreadfully you bore me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of your censure I am frankly growing tired.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With your diatribes eternally before me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How on earth can I expect to feel inspired?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You are orderly, no doubt, and systematic,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In that office where recumbent you recline;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You would modify your methods in an attic<br /></span>
<span class="i28">Such as mine.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If you lived a sort of hand-to-mouth existence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Where the mouth found less employment than the hand);<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If your rhymes would lend your humour no assistance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And your wit assumed a form that never scann'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you sat and waited vainly at your table<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While Calliope declined to give her cues,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You would realise how very far from <i>stable</i><br /></span>
<span class="i28">Was the <i>Mews</i>!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">You would find it quite impossible to labour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the patient perseverance of a drone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While some tactless but enthusiastic neighbour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Played a cake walk on a wheezy gramophone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While your peace was so disturbed by constant clatter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That at length you grew accustomed&mdash;nay, resigned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the never-ending victory of Matter<br /></span>
<span class="i28">Over Mind.<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">While <i>you</i> batten upon plovers' eggs and claret,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the shelter of some fashionable club,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I</i> am starving, very likely, in a garret,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Off the street so incorrectly labelled Grub,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the vintage smacks distinctly of the ink-butt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the atmosphere is redolent of toil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there's nothing for the journalist to drink but<br /></span>
<span class="i28">Midnight oil!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It is useless to solicit inspiration<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When one isn't in the true poetic mood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When one contemplates the prospect of starvation,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one's little ones are clamouring for food.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When one's tongue remains ingloriously tacit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One is forced with some reluctance to admit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, alas! (as Virgil said) <i>Poeta nascit</i>-<br /></span>
<span class="i28">-<i>Ur, non fit</i>!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then, my Publisher, be gentle with your poet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do not treat him with the harshness he deserves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, in fact, altho' you little seem to know it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You are gradually getting on his nerves.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kindly dam the foaming torrent of your curses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While I ask you,&mdash;yes, and pause for a reply,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are <i>you</i> writing this immortal book of verses,<br /></span>
<span class="i28">Or am <i>I</i>?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Gentle Reader, charge your tumbler<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With an&aelig;mic lemonade!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let us toast our fellow-fumbler,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who was surely born, not made.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None of all our friends is "dearer"<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In a dilatory way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plumbing the unmeasured deeps there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With some muttered vague excuse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the coinage that he keeps there,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Cigarettes he sometimes offers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a sort of old-world grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, when you accept them, proffers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With surprise, an empty case.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your cigars, instead, he'll snatch, and,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the cunning of the fox,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ask you firmly for a match, and<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Pocket half your box!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If with him a meal you share, too,<br /></span>

<h3>KING LEOPOLD</h3>

<p>("<i>In dealing with a race that has been composed of
cannibals for thousands of years, it is necessary to use
methods that best can shake their idleness and make them
realise the sanctity of labour.</i>"&mdash;King Leopold of Belgium
on the Congo scandal.)</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">People call him "knave" and "ogre" and a lot of kindred names,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or they label him as "tyrant" and "oppressor";<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The majority must wilfully misunderstand his aims<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To regard him in the light of a transgressor.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, to tell the honest truth, he's a benevolent old man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who attempts to do his "duty to his neighbour"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By endeavouring to formulate a philanthropic plan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which shall demonstrate the "sanctity of labour."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There were natives on the Congo not a score of years ago,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose existence was a constant round of pleasure;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose imperfect education had not ever let them know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pernicious immorality of leisure.<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
<span class="i0">They were merry little people, in their simple savage way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not a thought to moral obligations giving;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quite unconscious of their duties, wholly ignorant were they<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the blessedness of working for a living.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But a fond paternal Government (in Belgium, need I add?)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heard their story, and, with admirable kindness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deemed it utterly improper, not to say a trifle sad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the heathen should continue in his blindness.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Let us civilise the children of this most productive soil,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said their agents, who proceeded to invade them;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Let us show these foolish savages the dignity of toil&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If we have to use a hatchet to persuade them!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So they taught these happy niggers how unwise it was to shirk;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They implored them not to idle or malinger;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they showed them there was nothing that encouraged honest work<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the loss of sev'ral toes or half a finger.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When they fancied that their womenfolk were lonely or depress'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They would chain them nice and close to one another,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they thoughtfully abducted ev'ry baby at the breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To facilitate the labours of its mother.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So they made a point of parting ev'ry husband from his wife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dividing ev'ry maiden from her lover;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If a workman drooped or sickened they would jab him with a knife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then leave him by the roadside to recover.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If he grumbled or grew restive they would amputate a hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just to show him how unsafe it was to blubber,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till with infinite solicitude they made him understand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The necessity of cultivating "rubber."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thus the merry work progresses, as it must progress forsooth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While these pioneers are sharp and firm and wary,&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of that motto "Laborare est orare."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though the Belgians sometimes wonder, on their tenderhearted days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(When the little children scream as they abduct them),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If the natives CAN supply sufficient rubber to erase<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The effect of such endeavours to instruct them<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tho' within the royal bosom a suspicion there may lurk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That these practices offend the sister-nations,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That one cannot safely advocate "the sanctity of work,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By a policy of theft and mutilations,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet wherever on the Congo Belgium's banner is unfurled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the atmosphere is redolent and sunny,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
<span class="i0">I am sure the Monarch's methods must be giving to the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Some</i> ideas upon the "sanctity of money!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
